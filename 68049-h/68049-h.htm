<h2 class="nobreak">Betrayed by a Dog.</h2>
</div>


<p>Animals, especially dogs, have played an
important part in the affairs of men. There
is now in Chicago a dog that has become the
companion and assistant of a policeman, and
really does help his friend to detect and ferret
out thieves and other evil doers. I was once
concerned in a case in which a dog played a
most important part, and led finally, through
no fault of his own, however, to the detection
of his master.</p>

<p>The store of John Camden had been broken
into and the safe blown open and robbed of
a large sum of money. The cash had been
received that day too late to be deposited in
the bank. Next morning it was gone, and no
trace of the thief was to be found. At least,
Mr. Camden and his clerks and the police
officials found no trace of him. Not so with
me. I was sent to look up the affair. I found
the office in a state of confusion. The door of
the safe had been blown off and the contents
lay scattered over the floor. I asked Mr.
Camden if he had disturbed anything. He
said he had not, except to satisfy himself that
the money was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>Near by was a cat, dead, her throat cut
evidently by a hatchet that lay close at hand.
This seemed to me to be the basis of a clue.
Why had the cat been killed? It is not necessary
to kill cats in order to prevent them
from telling tales. I examined the unfortunate
feline more carefully. In addition to the ugly
cut on the throat there were other and more
significant marks upon the back. A saucer,
evidently having recently contained milk,
stood near by. Also an overturned can from
which pussy’s supply of milk had evidently
been obtained. The contents of this had been
consumed. Mr. Camden informed me that
this can had been filled with milk only the
previous evening. Among the papers scattered
upon the floor was one that attracted my
attention. It was a portion of a note written
in French. I was aware that Mr. Camden did
not write or speak French. I questioned him
about it. He could give me no information.
He had never seen it before.</p>

<p>“Did any one know you had a large sum of
money in the safe?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, a number of people knew of the fact.
I had been expecting to receive the money for
the past two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Who are those who know you had it?”</p>

<p>“My wife, brother, the man I sold the
property to (that is how I came to have such
a large sum at one time) and the real estate
dealers through whom I sold it.”</p>

<p>“Any one else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a friend, my daughter’s music
teacher. He it was who found me a purchaser
for the property.”</p>

<p>“He is a Frenchman, is he not, and is
invariably accompanied by his pretty little
dog?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; do you know him?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;never saw him. He knew you had a
large sum of money in the safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he saw me deposit it there.”</p>

<p>“When did he give your daughter her last
music lesson?”</p>

<p>“Last evening, but he complained of being
ill and went away earlier than usual.”</p>

<p>“Did he have his dog with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he claims the dog is his only friend.”</p>

<p>“Have you a specimen of his handwriting
at hand?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have several acknowledgments of
money received.”</p>

<p>He produced them. I compared the writing
with that of the note I had found near the safe.
They were, as far as I could determine, identically
the work of the same person.</p>

<p>Satisfied that I was on the right track, I
caused a watch to be put upon the music
teacher with the result that he was arrested as
he was about to leave the city. He made a
full confession.</p>

<p>“How did you guess it was a Frenchman
who robbed my safe, and that he was accompanied
by a pretty little dog?” inquired Mr.
Camden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>“I found the cat had been killed by a dog,
and his master afterward cut her throat with
the hatchet to ward off suspicion from the
dog; the dog drank the milk which had been
provided for the cat. I found a note written
in French and evidently dropped by the thief
near the safe, and his dog was a pretty little
animal because his master’s patrons, like
yourself, would not tolerate the presence of
any other kind, and you told me the dog
always accompanied his master.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Key to the Mystery.</h2>
</div>


<p>The most puzzling case upon which I ever
worked was that of the murder of John Long.
The facts are briefly these: Mr. Long, a
wealthy, retired merchant, living at the home
of his nephew, failed to answer the dinner-bell
one day. He was a man who always
prided himself upon his punctuality, and his
failure to appear at dinner at the usual hour
caused no little surprise. A messenger was
sent to his room to call him. No response
came to repeated knocks upon his chamber
door. The door was locked. Fearful that
something had happened to him, Mr. Brant&mdash;the
old gentleman’s nephew&mdash;set about breaking
down the door. This was no easy task, as
the door was made of oak and fastened by a
ponderous lock and large brass hinges. After
considerable effort the door yielded to their<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
blows and fell in. A horrible sight met the
gaze of the anxious family. Mr. Long lay
across the bed, cold and still in death, with his
throat cut from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Had the old man been murdered? If so,
how had the murderer entered the room? The
old man was known always to keep his door
locked. Besides, there did not appear to be
anything missing. If it was a case of suicide,
what had become of the implement with which
the deed had been done? It was nowhere to
be found. The old man always seemed in the
best of spirits, and had every thing to live for.</p>

<p>If not suicide, then it was, of course, murder.
Who, then, was the murderer?</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to be assigned to
work up the case. I say good fortune because
I like a difficult job, the more difficult the
better, and this was one of the most difficult
of all I had ever undertaken.</p>

<p>I examined the premises, and questioned the
family and the servants in order to learn all I
could about the murdered man, his habits,
his financial affairs, etc. In particular I examined
the room in which the foul murder had
been committed. One of the windows was
partially opened. This suggested the theory
that the murderer might have gained access to
the room by means of the window, but it was
impossible for him to have done this in broad
daylight, and the window was over 20 feet
from the ground.</p>

<p>One of those who seemed most eager to<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
believe that Mr. Long had committed suicide
was Thomas Brant, a scapegrace nephew of the
old man.</p>

<p>“If he committed suicide,” said I, “where
is the implement with which he did the deed?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he used his razor and then threw
it out of the window,” suggested Thomas.</p>

<p>“Impossible. The jugular vein was cut and
death must have been almost instantaneous.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I examined the grass under
the window (which opened over the orchard)
and found the old man’s razor. There was,
however, no blood upon it.</p>

<p>The most peculiar thing in the room was the
lock on the door and the key belonging to it.
It was a large lock, much larger than those
made at the present time, and the key was a
large, heavy, brass one weighing several
pounds. I was informed that this lock had
done duty in the door of the store in which
Mr. Long started in business, and when the
building was demolished, Mr. Long preserved
the lock and key (which, by the way, he had
designed himself). Furthermore, as soon as
he entered his room it was his custom to lock
his door, remove the key from the lock and
hang it upon a nail on the wall. Here it had
been found on the day of the murder. There
was believed to be but one such key in existence.
I believed otherwise, and made a tour
of all the lock-smith’s shops in the city in
order to verify my suspicions. At last my
search was rewarded. I found one who admitted,<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
although at first unwilling to do so,
that he had made a key similar to the one I
carried. He had made it for a young man
who answered to the description of Thomas
Brant. This much gained, the next step was
to connect Brant with the murder of his uncle.
This was soon done. Brant was sent to prison
for life, as it was not proved that he had
entered his uncle’s room for the purpose of
murder, but simply of robbery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Missing Finger.</h2>
</div>


<p>Red Joe was an industrious young man. He
worked early and late at his profession. While
others slept he toiled upward in the night; in
fact, night was his favorite time for toiling.
He didn’t exactly make hay while the sun
shone because he didn’t do any work while the
sun was shining on his side of the earth. He
was willing to put his hand to almost anything
that did not belong to him, and which he
could dispose of without fear of detection.
Red Joe was a burglar, and a most successful
one. That is to say, he succeeded so well at
the burglary business that he spent the greater
part of his time behind prison walls. He was
concerned, either alone, or in company with
others of his ilk, in some of the most important
“breaks” that the police have any record
of. Whenever a big burglary was committed,
the police invariably tried to connect Red Joe<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
with it, providing that gentleman didn’t happen
to be “otherwise engaged” at the time. This
was the case in the burglary of which I have
to tell. The facts are as follows:</p>

<p>The home of Mr. Reed, the rich banker, had
been broken into and a quantity of silver plate,
valued at $5,000, stolen. It had occurred during
the absence of the family. The affair was
reported to the police, and a large reward
offered for the detection and conviction of the
guilty parties. The police at once set about
unearthing and following up clues. But all
their labor was in vain. The burglar had carefully
covered up his tracks, and left no clue as
to his identity. Nobody had seen him enter or
leave the house. There was no one in the
house at the time of the robbery. The family
had gone off for the night, and the butler who
had been left in charge took advantage of
their absence to visit some of his friends. During
his absence&mdash;which he averred did not extend
over two hours&mdash;the burglar had come, seen
and conquered. He entered a poor man and
went away comparatively rich. At first the
butler was suspected and arrested, but he established
a satisfactory alibi and was soon released
from custody.</p>

<p>The police did all in their power to bring the
guilty ones to justice, but failed. The affair
was then placed in my hands. The solution of
the mystery seemed hopeless. The thief had
left no clue as to his identity, and none of the
booty had been disposed of at any of the pawn<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
shops in the city or surrounding cities. I did
not despair, however. I went to the scene of
the robbery and made a most thorough examination
of the premises. I found nothing. I
was about to give up when I came upon something
that promised to be a clue. I inquired
from the master of the house whether there had
been any repairs made in the house recently.
There had. The whole interior of the house
had been repainted and repapered just previous
to the robbery. In fact the finishing
touches had been given the very day the burglary
had been committed. Good. Then getting
the address of the painter and other workmen,
I went to them and made certain inquiries
which were answered to my satisfaction.
Then I reported at headquarters. Two days
later, Red Joe was arrested and charged with
the robbery. His premises were searched and
most of the stolen plate recovered. The clue
I had discovered was this. On the door frame
near the safe, was the imprint of fingers in the
then fresh varnish. The imprint of only the
thumb and three fingers appeared. One finger
was missing&mdash;the one next to the little finger.
This was a peculiarity of Red Joe’s right hand.
This discovery might mean a good deal for
me, possibly nothing. You know the result.
Red Joe was watched, and his suspicious actions
furnished sufficient grounds for the
issuing of a warrant for his arrest. He is now
“doing time.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Grave Robbery.</h2>
</div>


<p>One of the most peculiar cases with which I
have ever had to deal was that of a grave
robbery. The grave&mdash;or rather the vault, in
which the remains of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, a wealthy
Russian (I do not give his name for reasons
which will presently appear), had been deposited
was found disturbed two days after the
burial. Examination proved that the lid of
the casket had been removed with the apparent
intention of robbery. But, strange to say, no
robbery had been committed. The gold rings
on the fingers of the dead man had not been
touched, and these were the only valuables the
body contained. Why had the grave been
opened? Nobody could offer an explanation,
least of all I who had been detailed at the
desire of the family of the dead man to sift
this strange affair to the bottom, and discover,
if possible, who had dared to desecrate the
grave of their relative. Nothing had been
taken from the body as far as the family of the
dead man knew; yet the thief or thieves had
plenty of time in which to rob the body if they
so desired. They had not been frightened off.
They had carefully covered up the grave and
gone away evidently unmolested.</p>

<p>It was impossible to arrive at a conclusion as
to <em>why</em> the grave had been opened. It now
lay with me to find out <em>who</em> had done it. It
had rained during or previous to the time of
the grave robbery, and the footprints of those<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
concerned in it&mdash;three different persons it
appeared, were plainly discernible in the soft
ground. The signs of carriage wheels were
also present. This was my only clue upon
which I had to work. I questioned the superintendent,
whose office and residence was at
the entrance to the cemetery. He had been
away on the evening of the robbery, and could
give me no information. He was confident no
carriage had entered the cemetery after 10
o’clock, at which hour he had returned and
locked the cemetery gates. There was only
one carriage entrance to the cemetery. I had
an impression at the time that the man was
unnecessarily nervous in answering my questions,
and seemed relieved when I got through.</p>

<p>A month passed and an event occurred which
threw considerable light upon the mystery.
The will of the late Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; had been
opened and read. Among the many bequests
was the following most peculiar one: “I bequeath
to John Johnson, the dentist (with
address), a certain gold-capped tooth in my
lower jaw, and request that he extract this and
preserve it according to the terms of an agreement
made between us many years ago.” This
not only threw light upon, but complicated the
mystery. Perhaps the grave had been opened
to allow the dentist to claim his strange legacy.
Once more the body was disinterred by the
friends of the dead man. The gold-capped
tooth was missing from the lower jaw.</p>

<p>I next called upon John Johnson, the dentist.<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
Despite his American name I could see that he
was a foreigner&mdash;a Russian, I was certain.</p>

<p>I mentioned the occasion of my visit. “Did
you open the grave of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; and remove
a certain gold-capped tooth from the mouth of
the dead man?” I asked, point blank.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson seemed at a loss how to reply.
At last, he said “No.”</p>

<p>“Then the cemetery superintendent was
wrong. You did not drive in with two companions
in a carriage, and this is not your
card which I picked up near the grave of Mr.
L&mdash;&mdash;?” said I, showing him one of his business
cards which I had surreptitiously obtained.
“You might as well confess. You were only
getting your rights, after all, but why did you
go about it in such an underhanded way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“Are you not acquainted with the contents
of Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;’s will, the gold-capped tooth and
all?”</p>

<p>“Did he put that in the will?” inquired the
dentist in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“Then you do know something about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is a strange story, and if you will
promise&mdash;nay, swear&mdash;never to reveal it, I will
tell it to you. Do you swear?”</p>

<p>Something in the manner and bearing of the
man told me that he was no thief, and I readily
promised what he asked, and he told me the
following strange story:</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Strange Story.</h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Johnson conducted me into an inner
room, closed and locked the door and bade me
be seated.</p>

<p>“My name,” he began, “is not John Johnson.
I am living under an assumed name for
reasons of a political nature. I am a Russian
by birth, and a Nihilist by thought and training.
I deplore the condition of my unhappy
country. I have done my part and am still
willing to do it, to help bring about her freedom
from the terrible despotism under which she suffers.
I am acquainted with the horrors of Siberian
prison-mines. I was sentenced to Siberia for
life, for complicity in a Nihilistic plot. My
brother was sent there soon afterward. Together
we planned escape. I succeeded. He fell. Shot
down by an officer of his Despotic Majesty. I
managed to reach England, where I found many
friends. In London I became acquainted with
the late Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. He was also a Nihilist, and
a victim of Alexander’s wrath. He, too, was an
exile from his country. For either of us to return
meant instant capture at the hands of the Czar’s
well-trained police&mdash;or worse than that, Siberia.
I lived in London five years. There I learned the
trade of a dentist. Upon my banishment to Siberia,
my property had been confiscated to the
government.</p>

<p>“At the end of five years I came to the United
States, where I have lived ever since. Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;
came here soon after I did. He was a rich man.
Just previous to his arrest, he had managed to
convert most of his property into money which he
deposited in a London bank. This had been used
to effect his escape from Siberia. He had relatives<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
in this country with whom he lived up to
the time of his death. Soon after coming to this
country, he imparted to me a secret which had
been in his keeping for thirty years, it having
been transmitted to him by his father. He was
then a man of sixty. One day, ten years ago, he
came into my office&mdash;this very room&mdash;and said he
wished to speak with me upon a most important
matter, one concerning our beloved country.</p>

<p>“‘Do you see this tooth,’ he inquired, pointing
to a large, gold-capped molar in his lower jaw.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘That tooth,’ he continued, after having made
sure that we were alone, ‘that tooth holds, has held
for thirty years, a secret of the utmost importance
to you and me, and to all liberty loving Russians.
I tell you this because I know you will guard the
secret as you would your life. In the cavity of
that tooth, under the gold cap (here he lowered
his voice) is a piece of parchment which contains
the plans of a secret underground entrance to the
Czar’s palace at St. Petersburg, an entrance
which, as you will readily understand, will prove
of the utmost importance to our friends when the
time is ripe to use it. This plan has been in the
possession of our family for hundreds of years, having
been drawn originally by an ancestor of mine,
one of the designers of the palace. I am the last
male member of my family, and now bequeath
this secret to you. Upon my death, I desire that
you extract the tooth, and preserve or dispose of
the plan in whatever way seems best to you. You
know its importance. I can rely upon your judgment.
The dentist who inserted it in my tooth,
thirty years ago in Russia, is now dead. You and
I alone now hold the secret. Do you accept the
trust?’</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“That was Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;’s story.</p>

<p>“When he died I happened to be out of the
city. On my return I hastened to obtain possession
of the tooth in the manner that seemed best
to me. I was not aware that the matter was mentioned
in Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;’s will, which it would appear
he had intended to make public before his death,
but was unable to do so. The plan which I found
in the cavity of the tooth is now in safe hands in
Russia, and the world may yet learn whether the
well-guarded secret is destined to be utilized.</p>

<p>“I tell you this because I know you are an
American, a lover of liberty, and will not divulge
the secret I have told you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson died many years ago, and now I
give this story to the world, confident that even
its perusal by the Russian officials cannot in any
way endanger the secret of the gold-capped tooth.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
